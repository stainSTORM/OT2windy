    A static demander is a remote grant that has a static token. This token can
    for example have been retrieved from a configuration file beforehand and uniquely
    identifies the application on the fakts_next server. When using the static grant make
    sure that the token is not shared with other applications. As they can then mimik
    your application.

    Attention: If you are using the static grant, make sure that the token is not
    shared with other applications. As they can then mimik your application, especially
    when this static token maps to an client-credentials (user) application on the fakts_next
    server, as this application will then be able to access the data of the user that
    granted the application in the first place.
